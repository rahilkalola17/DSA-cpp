## Print Subsets of Array
Given an integer array (of length n), find and print all the subsets of input array.
Subsets are of length varying from 0 to n, that contain elements of the array. But the order of elements should remain same as in the input array.<br/>
Note : The order of subsets are not important. Just print the subsets in different lines.
### Input format :
Line 1 : Integer n, Size of array <br/>
Line 2 : Array elements (separated by space)
### Constraints :
1 <= n <= 15
### Sample Input:
3 <br/>
15 20 12 <br/>
### Sample Output:
[] (this just represents an empty array, don't worry about the square brackets) <br/>
12 <br/>
20 <br/>
20 12 <br/>
15 <br/>
15 12 <br/>
15 20 <br/>
