A straightforward question. Given an array of positive integers you have to print the number of subarrays whose XOR is less than K. Subarrays are<br/> defined as a sequence of continuous elements Ai, Ai+1, ..., Aj . XOR of a subarray is defined as Ai ^ Ai+1 ^ ... ^ Aj. Symbol ^ is Exclusive Or.<br/>

## Input Format
First line contains T, the number of test cases.<br/>
Each of the test case consists of N and K in one line, followed by N space separated integers in next line.<br/>

## Output Format
For each test case, print the required answer.

## Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 5 <br/>
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 <br/>
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^5 <br/>
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^6

## Sample Input
1 <br/>
5 2 <br/>
4 1 3 2 7

## Sample Output
3 <br/>
