### Segmented Sieve Problem
In this problem you have to print all primes from given interval.
### Input
t - the number of test cases, then t lines follows. [t <= 150] <br>
On each line are written two integers L and U separated by a blank. L - lower bound of  <br>
interval, U - upper bound of interval. [2 <= L < U <= 2147483647] [U-L <= 1000000].
### Output
For each test case output must contain all primes from interval [L; U] in increasing order.
### Sample Input:
2 <br>
2 10 <br>
3 7 <Br>
### Sample Output:
2 <Br>
3 <br>
5 <br>
7 <br>
3 <br>
5 <br>
7
