## Return subsets sum to K
Given an array A of size n and an integer K, return all subsets of A which sum to K.
Subsets are of length varying from 0 to n, that contain elements of the array. But the order of elements should remain same as in the input array.<br/>
Note : The order of subsets are not important.
### Input format :
